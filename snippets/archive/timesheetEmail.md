Subject: Timesheet - Public Holiday [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Hi Les,

Can you please confirm what notification was provided that you would be working the public holiday before I approve your timesheet? As we have previously discussed there must be agreement sought between yourself and your manager (in this case Daniella) before you work on days that are not considered.
