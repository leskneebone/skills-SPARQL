Hi Ellie, and welcome back (to both of us in a sense) 😊

I did not notify Daniella that I would be working on Monday 26 January. 

I don’t recall a discussion about agreements about work on days that are not considered. I do, regarding work beyond the expected and usual hours per week in my role. I may have missed something – really happy to take your direction here.

Cheers,

Les
