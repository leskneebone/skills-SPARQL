For the purposes of this use case, the learner pathway is anchored in the specific core and elective units undertaken by Francis as part of ICT30120. These units span security awareness, networking, systems administration, programming, web development, and professional practice. While not all units in ICT30120 were exhaustively modelled, the selected set is representative of the competencies typically acquired in a Cert III ICT pathway. Skills were extracted from these units and aligned using harmonised keywords and framework references, allowing their cybersecurity relevance to be analysed without altering or reinterpreting the original training package content.


Cert III units don’t use the term “cybersecurity”, but they clearly cover security-relevant practices (threat reporting, PII handling, privacy policy application, incident logging).
By augmenting extracted NST skills with harmonised keywords (including “cybersecurity” and adjacent terms), we create a bridge between TGA’s competency phrasing and HE / IT2017 disciplinary framing, enabling more accurate crosswalks and clearer credit-transfer reasoning—without rewriting the source material.

Across both ICT30120 and ICT40120, only five unit titles in each qualification include the string “cyber” (≈6.8% of modelled Cert III units and ≈8.9% of modelled Cert IV units). This shows why a bridge layer is needed: competency can be security-relevant without using contemporary disciplinary labels, so harmonised skill keywords provide the missing discoverability signal.

Across both ICT30120 (Cert III) and ICT40120 (Cert IV), only five unit titles in each qualification include the string “cyber”, representing fewer than ten percent of modelled units. This shows that disciplinary labels such as “cybersecurity” are not consistently used in TGA unit titles, even where security-relevant competencies are clearly present.
However, when competencies are extracted as NST skills and augmented with harmonised keywords, a different picture emerges. From ICT30120, 12 skills were extracted, of which only 3 were tagged as cybersecurity-related. From ICT40120, 77 skills were extracted, with 49 tagged as cybersecurity-related. This demonstrates that harmonised skill metadata makes disciplinary coverage visible without rewriting or misrepresenting the source material, and it clearly distinguishes the depth and breadth of capability between Cert III and Cert IV pathways.

schema:keywords = discoverability and harmonisation
skos:altLabel = eventual promotion for stable, genuinely synonymous terms

The current model supports alignment to the IT2017 Cybersecurity Principles framework as a whole, but does not yet differentiate skills by CSP sub-domain. This reflects the granularity of available source annotations rather than a limitation of the analytical approach.

When NST skills extracted from TGA units are aligned via their source units to the IT2017 Cybersecurity Principles framework, a clear progression emerges. From ICT30120 (Cert III), only four extracted skills align to the IT2017 Cybersecurity Principles, whereas ICT40120 (Cert IV) contributes forty-five such skills. This shows that Cert IV makes substantially greater use of disciplinary cybersecurity framing, even though the underlying unit titles themselves rarely use the term “cybersecurity”.
UC undergraduate IT units operate at a finer level of disciplinary articulation, with coursework explicitly structured around IT2017 sub-domains. The Cert IV therefore occupies a middle position: it shares a common cybersecurity framework with UC, while remaining less granular in its sub-disciplinary decomposition. This makes Cert IV a plausible semantic bridge into undergraduate IT study, whereas Cert III functions primarily as a preparatory or operational precursor.
