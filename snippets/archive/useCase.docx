# While higher education lacks a nationally standardised unit framework, discipline reference curricula such as the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula provide a structured, internationally recognised description of knowledge areas and learning expectations that could be modelled as a reference framework to support credit transfer and pathway analysis.

Francis is a graduate  in a Certificate III in Information technology and has been working in public and research libraries for over ten years. Over this time, Francis has moved into increasingly technical work – they have always performed systems administration roles, but after moving into a position at the State Library, Francis found themselves involved in library system development, procurement and requirements specification. 
Francis is now working in a digital transformation project where over a three-year period, many of the State Library system will be upgraded or displaced with new platforms, with data migration a key phase of the transition. The digital transformant will involve implementing more Software As A Service (SAAS) orientated solutions for both patron and staff facing applications. Solutions may be procured off-the-shelf, or may be developed in-house to meet specific requirements faced by State Library operations. The project team have also been advised that cyber-security is a key deliverable, as patron circulation data will flow between legacy and new systems. 
Francis is excited about the challenge ahead as there will be opportunities  to gain more technical skills from working with the IT and Systems team – but Francis also feels anxious about keeping up in increasing complex projects. Since completing the Certificate III, Francis has been learning ‘on the job’ about IT system management. In the transformation project, Francis will be a subject matter expert in systems administration, but they would like to contribute more in the design or specification of new systems. 
Francis wonders if more study will help with their role in the project. A further degree in something IT focused, perhaps at bachelor degree level, would be a great asset, but the time and cost to complete a higher education degree might be prohibitive. Perhaps some of the courses Francis completed in the Certificate III could count towards another degree? Can credit gained for the Certificate III be transferred towards partial completion of a higher degree?
Francis wants to get a fair idea of whether they are likely to be granted any credit by a HE provider before enrolling or paying any fees. Francis considers the academic transcript received at LumifyLearn to refresh their memory of what courses and topics were covered. Courses that Francis took were:
ICTICT310 Identify and use industry specific technologies
ICTICT317 Maintain standard operating environments
ICTSAS305 Provide ICT advice to clients
ICTICT313 Identify IP, ethics and privacy policies in ICT environments
ICTNWK309 Configure and administer network operating systems
BSBXTW301 Work in a team
ICTNWK307 Provide network systems administration
ICTPRG302 Apply introductory programming technologies
BSBCRT301 Develop and extend critical and creative thinking skills
ICTWEB304 Build simple web pages
BSBXCS303 Securely manage personally identifiable information and workplace information
BSBXCS302 Identify and report online security threats

-	Overview of Cyber Security
-	Introduction to Cloud Computing
-	Business Management
-	Networking and Routing Basics
-	Computer Architecture and Operating Systems
-	Systems Analysis and Design
-	Programming Principles
-	Database Management Systems
Francis thinks that some of these courses may be similar to the ones they completed and in any case has experience in: Business management; Networking and Routing Basics; Programming Principles; and Database Management Systems. Francis needs to know more about Cyber Security; Cloud Computing; Computer Architecture and Operating Systems; and Systems Analysis and Design. Francis is hoping that a bachelor degree can be gained by completing half of these courses. Importantly, the ‘Overview’ of Cyber Security needs to give them enough knowledge and skills to take a lead, or at least support the effort to ensuring that new library systems are secure. 
Francis investigates a new website that helps people fine pathways to new careers. 
Francis searches the website with the titles of the courses that they would like recognition of prior learning for, to see what is returned. Francis searches for: 
-	‘Business Management” which returns a skill [SK189613] Small Business Management – this does not look much like what Francis is looking for, although Skill has Keywords ‘Financial planning’ and ‘Spreadsheet tools’, which seem aligned with tasks and tools that Francis uses regularly in the library. 
-	‘Networking and Routing’ returns no results. Francis tries ‘Routing’ and gets 40 results! Francis isn’t sure which Skills are most relevant –they can see different industries or domain tags next to each one which helps Francis narrow down the list of interest. Francis selects the Skill “Network Routing Planning” [SK128804] which is in the Business Services and Administration domain and looks at the details. The description seems to fit well with their experience. The skill seems to be aligned with “ICTTEN421 Apply advanced routing protocols to network design” – and Francis can see that this course is part of eight qualifications, including the Certification IV in Computer Systems – is that different to a Certificate in information technology, wonders Francis? Francis makes a note of ‘Computer Systems’ as another phrase to search with in addition to ‘Information Technology. Francis also notices a Related skill is Network Specification Analysis [SK234003], which seems relevant to the project ahead. Francis clicks on the related skill also and finds that this skill is found in the “Develop energy sector computer network applications infrastructure” Course, and that this course is referenced by qualifications in electrical engineering and electronics – Francis is unsure now whether this is the right kind of ‘network’ field that they need to know about, and stops this line of investigation’
-	Francis considers themselves to be a competent programmer, and that they should be recognised as having completed requirements for the Programming Principles course. Francis searches for ‘Programming’, and there are 93 results! Here the domain categories are very useful – Francis can see at a glance that “Console Cue Programming”, a term they have never encountered before, is probably not relevant as it is in the Creative Arts, Culture & Entertainment domain. “HMI Programming” is also unfamiliar, but as it is in the “Digital Technology & ICT” domain, it might be worth a look at. 
-	Database Management Systems is the last course name Francis has come across where there may be a chance of transferring credit from their Certificate III to a Bachelor degree. Francis manages databases – but there are so many different database systems. Francis is not sure if the database systems used in the library are too specific or generic enough for their experience to count towards a broad understanding of database management. In the Certificate III, databases were introduced in broad terms. Francis searchers for ‘Database’, and 79 results are returned. A search for “library database” returns no results. A search for “library” returns 21 results – many of which are skills associated with ‘code libraries’ and not skills within a ‘library environment’. What domain would a library be found in, wonders Francis – business? Education? Creative arts and culture? The domain tagging has been useful for other searches but Francis does not know how the library sector or industry fits in with these domains. Francis returns to the 79 results for ‘Database’ and scans the Business services and administration group. Franics selects Database Information Management [SK099975], and sees from the description, keywords and related skills that this may be a good place to investigate. This skill seems to be related to many different courses –
